- Organize by material type: Product Briefs, Sales Decks, Datasheets, etc.
- Organize by product/universe: Sub-folders for each product/universe
- Enable access control: PMMs can upload/edit, Sales teams can view/download
- Evolve to platform: Once materials are centralized, build platform features on top

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **This Week:** Set up centralized storage location (SharePoint/Drive/etc.) with folder structure
2. **Week 2:** Create folder structure: 
   - By Material Type (Product Briefs, Sales Decks, Datasheets, etc.)
   - By Product/Universe (sub-folders)
   - By Audience (Internal vs Customer-Facing)
3. **Week 3:** PMMs upload all existing materials to appropriate folders
4. **Week 4:** Set up access permissions, test with sales teams, gather feedback

**Folder Structure Example:**
```
Materials/
├── Internal/
│   ├── Product Briefs/
│   │   ├── Product A/
│   │   ├── Product B/

- **C**ombine: What could you combine?
- **A**dapt: How could you adapt?
- **M**odify: What could you modify?
- **P**ut to other uses: New applications?
- **E**liminate: What could you remove?
- **R**everse: What if you reversed the approach?

### Focus Areas for Development

Based on our brainstorming and quick wins identification, we'll develop:

1. **Quick Win Concepts** - Refine the 5 quick wins we identified
2. **High-Impact Ideas** - Develop breakthrough concepts further
3. **Integration Opportunities** - Connect ideas across themes

Let's begin systematic development using SCAMPER...

### SCAMPER Development: Quick Win #0 - Central Material Repository

**Original Concept:** Centralized file storage with organized folder structure for all materials

#### **S - Substitute**
**What could we substitute?**

- **Substitute file storage with platform:** Instead of just file storage, could we substitute with a content management platform that includes version control, search, and metadata?
- **Substitute manual organization with auto-tagging:** Could we substitute manual folder placement with automatic tagging based on material metadata?
- **Substitute single storage with distributed:** Could we substitute centralized storage with distributed storage (cloud) that syncs?

**Developed Ideas:**
- **Hybrid Approach:** Start with file storage (quick win), but design folder structure to easily migrate to platform later
- **Metadata-First Design:** Structure folders so they can become metadata tags in future platform
- **Cloud-Native:** Use cloud storage (SharePoint/Drive) that supports future platform integration

#### **C - Combine**
**What could we combine?**

- **Combine storage with inventory:** Could we combine the repository with the inventory spreadsheet (integrated tracking)?
- **Combine upload with validation:** Could we combine upload process with automatic validation (naming, format checks)?
- **Combine storage with discovery:** Could we combine repository with search/discovery features from the start?

**Developed Ideas:**
- **Repository + Inventory Integration:** Inventory spreadsheet links directly to repository files
- **Upload + Quality Check:** Upload process includes automatic checks (naming convention, file format)
- **Storage + Basic Search:** Even in file storage phase, add searchable index/spreadsheet for discovery

#### **A - Adapt**
**How could we adapt?**

- **Adapt from library systems:** How do libraries organize materials? Could we adapt Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress systems?
- **Adapt from product catalogs:** How do e-commerce sites organize products? Could we adapt category/tag systems?
- **Adapt from version control:** How do developers organize code? Could we adapt Git-like branching for material versions?

**Developed Ideas:**
- **Taxonomy System:** Adapt library classification - materials have "call numbers" (categories) for easy location
- **Tag-Based Organization:** Adapt e-commerce tagging - materials can have multiple tags (product, use case, audience)
