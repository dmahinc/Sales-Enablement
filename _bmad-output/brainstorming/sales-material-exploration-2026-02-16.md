# Brainstorming Session: Sales Material Exploration

**Facilitator:** AI Assistant  
**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Focus:** How Sales Reps Explore and Discover Materials in the Platform

---

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Material Exploration - Enabling Sales Reps to effectively explore and discover materials from the entire bank

**Core Question:** How can we help Sales personas better explore what's inside the bank of materials available for them and their customers?

**Goals:**
- **A. Exploration Patterns:** Understand how sales reps want to explore materials
- **B. Discovery Mechanisms:** Design intuitive ways to discover materials
- **C. Material Organization:** Organize materials for easy exploration
- **D. Search & Filter Improvements:** Enhance search and filtering capabilities

---

## Phase 1: Current State Analysis

### Current Exploration Methods

**What Sales Reps Currently Have:**
1. **Search Bar** - Text-based search
2. **Filters** - Universe, Type, Status, Product
3. **Discovery Page** - List/grid view of materials
4. **Dashboard Stats** - Popular materials, recently viewed
5. **Material Types Grid** - Browse by type

### Current Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Example |
|------------|--------|---------|
| **No visual exploration** | Can't see materials at a glance | Have to click each material |
| **No relationship mapping** | Can't see related materials | Don't know what goes together |
| **No context-based discovery** | Generic search results | Same results for all scenarios |
| **No material preview** | Must download to see content | Wastes time downloading wrong materials |
| **No exploration paths** | Linear search only | Can't browse by journey |
| **Limited filtering** | Basic filters only | Can't filter by persona, use case, etc. |

---

## Phase 2: What If Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Visual Material Map
**What if:** Sales reps could see all materials on an interactive map?
- **Visual representation:** Materials as nodes, connected by relationships
- **Zoom levels:** Universe → Category → Product → Materials
- **Color coding:** By type, freshness, popularity
- **Interaction:** Click to explore, drag to organize

### Scenario 2: Guided Exploration
**What if:** Sales reps had a guided tour of materials?
- **Wizard mode:** Step-by-step material discovery
- **Context questions:** "Who is your customer?" → Shows relevant materials
- **Progressive disclosure:** Start broad, narrow down
- **Save exploration:** Save exploration paths for reuse

### Scenario 3: Material Relationships
**What if:** Materials were connected like a knowledge graph?
- **Related materials:** "Materials often used together"
- **Material chains:** "If you need X, you might also need Y"
- **Dependency mapping:** "This material references that product"
- **Journey mapping:** "Materials for this customer journey"

### Scenario 4: Smart Recommendations
**What if:** The system learned what materials sales reps need?
- **Context-aware:** Recommendations based on current customer
- **Time-based:** "Materials for Monday morning prep"
- **Success-based:** "Materials that led to wins"
- **Team-based:** "What your team is using"

### Scenario 5: Material Preview
**What if:** Sales reps could preview materials without downloading?
- **Thumbnail gallery:** Visual preview of all materials
- **Quick view:** Inline preview on hover/click
- **Slide preview:** For presentations, see first few slides
- **Content preview:** See material description, key points

---

## Phase 3: Morphological Analysis

### Exploration Dimensions

| Dimension | Options | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Entry Point** | Search, Browse, Recommendations, Collections, Playbooks | How sales rep starts exploration |
| **View Mode** | List, Grid, Map, Timeline, Tree, Gallery | Visual representation |
| **Filter Type** | Product, Persona, Use Case, Material Type, Freshness, Popularity | Filtering mechanism |
| **Organization** | Universe, Category, Product, Persona, Use Case, Journey | How materials are organized |
| **Interaction** | Click, Hover, Drag, Swipe, Pinch, Voice | How sales rep interacts |
| **Context** | Customer Meeting, Follow-up, Training, Research | Exploration context |

### Combination Ideas

## Phase 4: SCAMPER Analysis

### Substitute
- **Current:** Text search → **Substitute:** Visual search (upload customer slide, find similar materials)
- **Current:** Manual browsing → **Substitute:** AI-guided exploration
- **Current:** Static filters → **Substitute:** Dynamic, context-aware filters
- **Current:** List view → **Substitute:** Card-based visual gallery

### Combine
- **Combine:** Search + Filters + Recommendations = Smart Discovery Bar
- **Combine:** Material viewing + Related materials = Exploration Sidebar
- **Combine:** Persona + Use Case + Product = Contextual Material Sets
- **Combine:** Popular + Fresh + Recommended = Smart Material Feed

### Adapt
- **Adapt:** E-commerce product discovery → Material discovery
- **Adapt:** Spotify music discovery → Material recommendations
- **Adapt:** Pinterest visual browsing → Material pinboard
- **Adapt:** Netflix content organization → Material collections

### Modify
- **Modify:** Search-first → Browse-first exploration
- **Modify:** Material-centric → Customer-centric exploration
- **Modify:** Single material view → Material relationship view
- **Modify:** Static organization → Dynamic, personalized organization

### Put to Other Use
- **Put to use:** Material bank → Sales playbook builder
- **Put to use:** Material exploration → Sales training tool
- **Put to use:** Material relationships → Customer journey mapper
- **Put to use:** Material preview → Quick reference guide

### Eliminate
- **Eliminate:** Need to know exact material name
- **Eliminate:** Multiple clicks to find materials
- **Eliminate:** Download to preview
- **Eliminate:** Manual material organization

### Reverse
- **Reverse:** Sales finds materials → Materials find sales (push recommendations)
- **Reverse:** Search → Browse-first approach
- **Reverse:** Generic exploration → Personalized exploration paths
- **Reverse:** Material selection → Material elimination (show what NOT to use)

## Phase 5: Six Thinking Hats Analysis

### White Hat (Facts & Information)
**What we know:**
- Sales reps need materials quickly (5-15 min prep time)
- Materials are organized by universe, product, type
- Sales reps think in personas and use cases
- Current search is text-based only
- No visual exploration available

**What we need to know:**
- How do sales reps currently organize materials mentally?
- What triggers material discovery? (Customer question, product mention, etc.)
- How many materials do sales reps typically review before selecting?
- What makes a material "discoverable"?

### Red Hat (Feelings & Emotions)
**Sales rep feelings:**
- **Frustration:** "I know the material exists but can't find it"
- **Overwhelm:** "Too many materials, don't know where to start"
- **Confidence:** "I want to use the right material for this customer"
- **Time pressure:** "I need this in 5 minutes, not 15"

**Emotional goals:**
- Feel confident they're using the right materials
- Feel efficient and productive
- Feel supported, not overwhelmed
- Feel like they're discovering new useful materials

### Black Hat (Critical Thinking - Risks)
